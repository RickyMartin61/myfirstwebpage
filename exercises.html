                    <h2>🏋️ What is a Back Workout?</h2>
                    <p>
                        A back workout strengthens the muscles along your spine and upper back, including the lats, traps, and rhomboids.
                        These muscles help you with pulling, lifting, and posture. Simple exercises like rows, reverse flys, and supermans 
                        can improve strength and reduce back pain - even at home!

                    <p>
                        A chest workout targets the muscles in your chest, mainly the pectorals. These muscles help you push, lift, and support
                        your upper body. Chest exercises like push-ups, chest presses, and dumbbell flys build strength, improve posture, 
                        and help shape your upper body. You can start with simple bodyweight moves at home no equipment needed!

                    <h2>💪 What is a Bicep Workout?</h2>
                    <p>
                        A bicep workout focuses on strengthening the muscles at the front of your upper arms, called the biceps. These muscles 
                        help you lift, pull, and carry things in daily life. Bicep exercises, like curls, use simple movements to build strength
                        and tone your arms. You can do them at home using dumbbells, resistance bands, or even water bottles no gym needed!

                    <p>
                        Tricep workouts focus on the muscles at the back of your upper arms. These triceps help you push and extend your arms.
                        Exercises like tricep dips, extensions, and close-grip push-ups build arm strength and help tone the back of your arms 
                        no gym required.

                    <h2>💪 What is a Shoulder Workout?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Shoulder workouts target the deltoid muscles, which control arm movement and stability. Strong shoulders help with 
                        lifting and carrying in everyday life. Beginners can start with shoulder presses, front raises, and arm circles to build
                        strength and improve mobility.

                    <h2>🦵 What is a Leg Workout?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Leg workouts train the major lower body muscles: quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. These muscles support walking,
                        running, and balance. Squats, lunges, and step-ups are great beginner exercises you can do anywhere - with or without 
                        weights.

                    <h2>✔️ Carbs Before Your Workout</h2>
                    <p>
                        Carbs are your body's main energy source. Eating carbs before training
                        helps fuel your muscles and improves performance.

                    <h2>✔️ Protein After Your Workout</h2>
                    <p>
                        Protein helps repair muscle fibers and supports growth after exercise.
                        It speeds up recovery and builds stronger muscles.
