        <p class="introduction-text">
            This section provides beginner-friendly exercises with proper form tips, workout plans,
            and nutritional advice to help you get started safely and effectively. No gym? No problem —
            many exercises can be done at home!

                <h2>🏋️‍♀️ What is a Back Workout?</h2>
                <p>
                    A back workout strengthens the muscles along your spine and upper back,
                    including the lats, traps, and rhomboids. These muscles help you with pulling,
                    lifting, and posture. Simple exercises like rows, reverse flys, and supermans 
                    can improve strength and reduce back pain — even at home!

                <h2>🏋️ What is a Chest Workout?</h2>
                <p>
                    A chest workout targets the muscles in your chest, mainly the pectorals.
                    These muscles help you push, lift, and support your upper body. Chest exercises
                    like push-ups, chest presses, and dumbbell flys build strength, improve posture,
                    and help shape your upper body. You can start with simple bodyweight moves at home —
                    no equipment needed!

                <h2>💪 What is a Bicep Workout?</h2>
                <p>
                    A bicep workout strengthens the muscles at the front of your upper arms. 
                    These muscles help you lift, pull, and carry things in daily life. 
                    Exercises like curls build strength and tone your arms using simple 
                    movements — dumbbells, resistance bands, or even water bottles work!

                <h2>💪 What is a Tricep Workout?</h2>
                <p>
                    Tricep workouts focus on the muscles at the back of your upper arms. 
                    These muscles help you push and extend your arms. Exercises like dips, 
                    extensions, and close-grip push-ups build strength and help tone the 
                    back of your arms — no gym required.

                <h2>💪 What is a Shoulder Workout?</h2>
                <p>
                    Shoulder workouts target the deltoid muscles responsible for arm movement 
                    and stability. Strong shoulders help with lifting and carrying in everyday life. 
                    Beginners can start with shoulder presses, front raises, and arm circles to build 
                    strength and improve mobility.

                <h2>🦵 What is a Leg Workout?</h2>
                <p>
                    Leg workouts train the major lower body muscles: quads, hamstrings, glutes, 
                    and calves. These muscles support walking, running, and balance. Squats, 
                    lunges, and step-ups are great beginner exercises you can do anywhere — 
                    with or without weights.

        <h1>Nutrition Tips</h1>

        <div class="exercise-box">
            <div class="exercise-text">
                <h2>✔ Carbs before your workout</h2>
                <p>
                    Carbohydrates are your body’s main source of energy. Eating carbs before 
                    exercising helps fuel your muscles and gives you the stamina to perform 
                    at your best. Without enough carbs, you may feel tired or weak during 
                    your workout.

                <h2>✔ Protein after your workout</h2>
                <p>
                    Protein is essential for muscle recovery and repair. After exercising, 
                    your muscles experience micro-tears. Protein helps rebuild these muscles, 
                    making them stronger and promoting growth — perfect for beginners trying 
                    to gain strength.
